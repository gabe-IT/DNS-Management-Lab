# DNS Management Lab Exercise

## A-Record Exercise

1. **Connect/log into DC-1 as your domain admin account (mydomain.com\jane_admin)**:
   - Open Remote Desktop Connection or use Azure Portal to connect to DC-1.
   - Log in using the credentials for the domain admin account.

2. **Connect/log into Client-1 as an admin (mydomain\jane_admin)**:
   - Open Remote Desktop Connection or use Azure Portal to connect to Client-1.
   - Log in using the credentials for the admin account (mydomain\jane_admin).

3. **Attempt to Ping "mainframe" from Client-1**:
   - Open Command Prompt on Client-1.
   - Type `ping mainframe` and notice that it fails to resolve.

4. **Nslookup for "mainframe"**:
   - In the same Command Prompt on Client-1, type `nslookup mainframe`.
   - Observe that it fails to find the DNS record for "mainframe".

5. **Create a DNS A-record for "mainframe" on DC-1**:
   - Return to DC-1.
   - Open DNS Manager.
   - Navigate to the forward lookup zone for your domain.
   - Create a new A-record for "mainframe" pointing to DC-1â€™s Private IP address.

6. **Verify Ping Connectivity from Client-1**:
   - Go back to Client-1.
   - Ping "mainframe" again (`ping mainframe`) and observe that it resolves successfully.

## Local DNS Cache Exercise

1. **Change mainframe's Record Address on DC-1**:
   - Return to DC-1.
   - Edit the A-record for "mainframe" in DNS Manager to point to 8.8.8.8.

2. **Ping "mainframe" from Client-1 Again**:
   - Go back to Client-1.
   - Ping "mainframe" (`ping mainframe`) and notice that it still resolves to the old address.

3. **Observe the Local DNS Cache on Client-1**:
   - Open Command Prompt on Client-1.
   - Type `ipconfig /displaydns` to view the local DNS cache.

4. **Flush the Local DNS Cache**:
   - In the same Command Prompt, type `ipconfig /flushdns`.
   - Observe the message confirming the cache has been flushed.

5. **Attempt to Ping "mainframe" Again**:
   - Ping "mainframe" (`ping mainframe`) and notice that it now resolves to the new address.

## CNAME Record Exercise

1. **Create a CNAME Record on DC-1**:
   - Return to DC-1.
   - Open DNS Manager.
   - Navigate to the forward lookup zone for your domain.
   - Create a new CNAME record for "search" pointing to "www.google.com".

2. **Attempt to Ping "search" from Client-1**:
   - Go back to Client-1.
   - Ping "search" (`ping search`) and observe the results showing the resolved IP address of "www.google.com".

3. **Nslookup "search" on Client-1**:
   - In Command Prompt on Client-1, type `nslookup search`.
   - Observe the results showing the canonical name (CNAME) record for "search" pointing to "www.google.com".
